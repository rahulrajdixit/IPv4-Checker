# IPv4-Checker

## **Please Note**
- This is a simple tool to check if a given IP Address is valid or not, and if it is a valid one, then just some general information about it.
- The the tool does not have any dependencies for calculations involving the IP Addresses. Only certain libraries are being used for the frontend generation.
- The methods were developed by me just out of curiosity, to understand how an IP Address could be validated. Hence, there is a possibility for finding errors.
- I had made this tool some time back. If anyone wants to improve the code, then please feel free to contribute.

## **Introduction**
This is a simple IPv4 (IP Address) Checker. This small tool can:- 
> 1) Help find out the details regarding the IP Address (Class, Subnet Mask). 
> 2) Analyse the given IP Address and then determine any kinds of errors in the input/format/etc.

This tool was made just for fun and out of curiosity, in my 2nd year of B.Tech (2019). It was made, just to understand the logic behind the IP address-validity checking in different softwares and applications. There is a possibility that my apporach to validate the IP Address is wrong.

## **How to use it?
1. Download the zip file, and extract it. The program files should be in `IPv4-Checker-main` folder.
2. Open CMD or Terminal and come to the directory where the program files are present. The directory location would mostly be `C:\Users\username\Downloads\IPv4-Checker-main\IPv4-Checker-main>` .
3. To run the program, we first need our java compiler (javac) to convert our source code (`IPv4GUI.java`) to bytecode (`IPv4GUI.class`). For that, we use the following command:-
```java
javac IPv4GUI.java
```
4. The bytecode is now generated by the java compiler. Now, use the following command to start the tool:-
```java
java IPv4GUI
```
5. You can now see the Graphical-User-Interface of the tool is now available. Try out different values and test if the IP Address is valid or not. Some of the values could be:
> Valid Values 
> - 192.168.1.4 
> - 10.10.0.1
> 127.0.0.1

> Invalid Values
> - 673.5.35.abc
> - 1.5345.1
> - 2A:5D:3B:5E:7B
