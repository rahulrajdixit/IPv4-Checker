# IPv4-Checker

## **Please Note**
- This is a simple tool to check if a given IP Address is valid or not, and if it is a valid one, then just some general information about it.
- The the tool does not have any dependencies for calculations involving the IP Addresses. Only certain libraries are being used for the frontend generation.
- The methods were developed by me just out of curiosity, to understand how an IP Address could be validated. Hence, there is a possibility for finding errors.
- I had made this tool some time back. If anyone wants to improve the code, then please feel free to contribute.

## **Introduction**
This is a simple IPv4 (IP Address) Checker. This small tool can:- 
> 1) Help find out the details regarding the IP Address (Class, Subnet Mask). 
> 2) Analyse the given IP Address and then determine any kinds of errors in the input/format/etc.

This tool was made just for fun and out of curiosity, in my 2nd year of B.Tech (2019). It was made, just to understand the logic behind the IP address-validity checking in different softwares and applications. There is a possibility that my apporach to validate the IP Address is wrong.
